# telepass-rails-template

## Getting started
Application templates are simple Ruby files containing DSL for adding gems, initializers, etc. to your freshly created Rails project or an existing Rails project. See [Official Rails Site](https://guides.rubyonrails.org/rails_application_templates.html)

### Why
when you need to create a new project, you definitely need an initial setup phase. This little template will help you configure most of popular and used gems:
- [FactoryBot Rails](https://github.com/thoughtbot/factory_bot_rails)
- [Fuubar](https://github.com/thekompanee/fuubar)
- [Pry](https://github.com/pry/pry)
- [Rspec](https://github.com/rspec/rspec-rails)
- [Rubocop](https://github.com/rubocop/rubocop)
- [Shoulda Matchers](https://github.com/thoughtbot/shoulda-matchers)
- [Simplecov](https://github.com/simplecov-ruby/simplecov)
- [VCR](https://github.com/vcr/vcr)
- [Config](https://github.com/rubyconfig/config)
- [Dotenv](https://github.com/bkeepers/dotenv)
